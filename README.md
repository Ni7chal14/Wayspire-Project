Fraud Mask Detection System

Fraud News Detection System

Image Caption Generator


üß† 1. Fraud Mask Detection System
This project uses OpenCV and a pre-trained deep learning model to perform real-time face mask detection through a webcam feed. It identifies faces and classifies whether a person is wearing a mask or not. The system was built using Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, and a CNN-based architecture. It can be deployed in public places to monitor compliance with health safety protocols.



üì∞ 2. Fraud News Detection System
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to classify news articles as real or fake. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques like TF-IDF vectorization and a logistic regression classifier. Built with Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and NLTK, the model helps detect misinformation in textual data, making it useful for social media monitoring and media verification tools.


üñºÔ∏è 3. Image Caption Generator
This deep learning project generates textual captions for input images using a combination of CNN and RNN architectures. Features were extracted from images using a pre-trained InceptionV3 model, and captions were generated using an LSTM-based decoder. The system was developed in Python using TensorFlow/Keras and trained on the Flickr8K dataset. It demonstrates how computer vision and NLP can be combined for automatic image understanding.
